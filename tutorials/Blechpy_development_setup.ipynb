    "First create a virtual environment using whichever method you choose. I prefer using Miniconda and python 3.7. Later versions of python 3 should work fine. \n",

    "## Create an environment for testing changes\n",
    "This is a separate conda environment where you install blechpy in editable mode so you can test your changes before delpoying. \n",
    "\n",
    "First close the (blechpy)[https://github.com/nubs01/blechpy] repo from github.\n",

    "- Go to pypi.org\n",
    "- Create an account\n",

    "## Making Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can clone the blechpy github repository and begin editting and improving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to: \n",
    "- create a new branch \n",
    "- edit that branch\n",
    "- test\n",
    "- merge back to master\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make edits,\n",
    "- Make new functions as small, modular and general as possible\n",
    "- Use docstring style already used in blechpy package \n",
    " - blechpy dosumentation is made using pdoc which automatically generates the documentation webpage from the docstrings\n",
    "- Try not to break anything\n",
    "- Avoid spaghetti code: don't import modules into other modules that depend on the imported module, i.e. Don't import `blechpy.datastructures.dataset` into `blechpy.dio.h5io`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building and deploying to pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "- Update the CHANGES.txt file to include a descriptions of the changes you have made\n",
    "- Update version number in setup.py\n",
    "- Activate dev environment: `conda activate dev` \n",
    "- Build: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`\n",
    "- Deploy: `twine upload --verbose --skip-existing dist/*`\n",
    " - enter your username and password for pypi"
