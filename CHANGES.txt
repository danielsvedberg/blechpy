v1.1.5, (2019-10-07)
-------------------
- Included pyqt5 in requirements, necessary for plotting since I like the pyqt5 matplotlib backend
- Fixed blechpy.h5io.common_average_reference to handle uneven raw trace lengths (for a cutoff recording)
    - now truncates data to match shortest trace
    - Can mark channels as dead to exclude them and try and save good channels

v1.1.4, (2019-10-07) -- Actually saves dataset after clustering

v1.1.3, (2019-10-07)
-------------------
-Critical bug fix:
    - Clustering now actually works and reports problems
    - Clustering now excludes clustering of channels marked as dead

v1.1.2, (2019-10-07)
-------------------
- Critical bug fix:
    - blechpy.dio.h5io now properly importing referenced traces
    - blechpy.analysis.blech_clust_process now properly choosing raw data only
      if referenced data is not available

v1.1.1, (2019-10-06)
-------------------
- Fixed critical bugs in new dataset creation:
    - Indentation error causing CAR groups to not be assigned properly
    - info.rhd corruption checking

- Can run from setup through clustering with only a single prompt if desired 
    - Allows you to programmatically setup, extract and cluster many recordings without staying near the keyboard


v1.1.0, (2019-10-05)
-------------------
- Fixed requirments and setup.py so that project properly installs via pip.
- Fix default parameter loading
- Change deprecated scipy.misc.imread to imageio.imread in blech_waveforms_datashader

v1.0.0, October 5, 2019 -- Initial release
